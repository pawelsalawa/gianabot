# GianaBot
IRC bot from back in time (2003). It was a project I was working on as a teenager and I recently I digged it out of my backups.

It had some concepts similar to Eggdrop (botnet, interactive console, channel commands, pluginable scripting), some were new and innovative (for example it used sort algorithm to determin friends and foes on a channel, so entire botnet reacted to takeover attempt at once, without waiting for any communication between bots).

It was written entirely in Tcl.
