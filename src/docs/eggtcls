* This is not most important thing to port eggdrop TCL commands
  to Giana, so I don't spend much time on it. Also not all commands
  are needed. There will be support only for most important commands.
* Any supported commands are without switches.
* Many commands doesn't work exactly same as in eggdrops, so there
  are required some corrections for them in script code. Most of
  needed corrections are described below supported commands index.
* Supported commands so far:
    putserv
    putkick
    putlog
    putdcc
    putkick
    putquick
    validuser
    nick2hand
    dccbroadcast
    boot
    unixtime



Needed corrections:
* In putdcc first argument is user name, not as in eggdrops, dcc ident.
* Replace any utimer and timer by after (clean TCL) command. Also utimers
  and timers commands will be not supported. Do their work by another way.
