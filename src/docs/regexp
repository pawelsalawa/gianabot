*** Regular expression short description. ***

Regular expression is used to match irc server data,
so it's good to know it well. For full description
go to TCL documentation. There are some aliases made
for Giana, which enables glob-style matching for regexp.

Following chars are supported in 'on' pattern:
?               - matches exactly one char
%               - matches exactly one word
*               - matches 0, or more chars
[any_chars]     - matches chars from
                  inside of brackets
[^any_chars]    - matches chars, which
                  aren't inside brackets

Examples:

1.
on {:% 367 % % *} {code...}
Matches irc protocol message number 367. Also matches it
only if after 367 are 2 words and meaby somthing more.

2
on {:%!%@% NOTICE [#!+]% :*} {code...}
This pattern matches notices sent by some user
(not server, becouse we match %!%@%, which can got
only users) to channel, which isn't &channel (becouse
there is no & char inside [] brackets). Notice data
can be everything becouse of *. &channels aren't useful
for simple users, so notices from that channels aren't
welcome. If there are channels which starts with another
char than #, !, or +, then you can use [^&] to match
any channels which don't starts with &.
