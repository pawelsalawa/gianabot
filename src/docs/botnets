Creating botnets by Giana bots is very easy.
Most simple botnet:

    Hub
   /   \
Leaf1  Leaf2

To make this botnet you have to execute following commands:
on Hub:
+bot leaf1 address.of.leaf1.org:bots_port_on_leaf1/users_port_on_leaf1
+bot leaf2 address.of.leaf2.org:bots_port_on_leaf2/users_port_on_leaf2
on Leaf1:
+bot hub address.of.hub.org:bots_port_on_hub/users_port_on_hub
and same command on Leaf2:
+bot hub address.of.hub.org:bots_port_on_hub/users_port_on_hub
Now you can execute link command to link bots:
on Leaf1:
link hub
on Leaf2:
link hub
And done... Now botnet works.

Now let make some bigger and more advanced botnet, which will looks like:

          __Hub__
         /   |   \
    Slave1 Slave2 Slave3
  /    |     |      |    \
Leaf1 Leaf2 Leaf3 Leaf4 Leaf5

So, on hub:
+bot slave1 address.of.slave1:bots_port/users_port
+bot slave2 address.of.slave2:bots_port/users_port
+bot slave3 address.of.slave3:bots_port/users_port

on Slave1:
+bot hub address.of.hub:bots_port/users_port
+bot leaf1 address.of.leaf1:bots_port/users_port
+bot leaf2 address.of.leaf2:bots_port/users_port

on Slave2:
+bot hub address.of.hub:bots_port/users_port
+bot leaf3 address.of.leaf3:bots_port/users_port

on Slave1:
+bot hub address.of.hub:bots_port/users_port
+bot leaf4 address.of.leaf4:bots_port/users_port
+bot leaf5 address.of.leaf5:bots_port/users_port

on Leaf1 and Leaf2:
+bot slave1 address.of.slave1:bots_port/users_port

on Leaf3:
+bot slave2 address.of.slave2:bots_port/users_port

on Leaf4 and Leaf5:
+bot slave3 address.of.slave3:bots_port/users_port

Now you can use link command to link bots. There is no
rule, which bot will link first, which second, etc.
Just link them in any sequence.
Generally, add all bots, which bot should link directly
and link them.
You have not add hostmasks for added bots (but you can),
becouse if bot detects that he doesn't got any hostmask of bot,
which he has just linked with, he adds it automatically.

When you link all bots, you can execute command setlinks.
Bots will remember their links and will link automatically
after start. You can also add links to remember by +link/-link.
