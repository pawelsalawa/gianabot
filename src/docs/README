Giana 2 IRC Bot by Pawel Salawa
(Googie at IRCNet and EFNet, boogie@tl.krakow.pl)

This is completly rewritten and modified version
of Giana Bot 1.x, which was written in EPIC4 shell.
There are similar ideas, but made better and in more faster,
more powerful language, which is TCL. This language is well known
by a lot of people, so if you are one of them, then take a look
to scripting document. Also Eggdrop TCL scripts should be fine
for Giana2, but with small changes.

Already Giana2 supports (currently) only IRCNet for sure, but it
should works also on EFnet and similar networks. Services and other
features of DALnet and Undernet networks are not supported yet.

Directories description:

              with PID ident.

INSTALLING:
-----------
Installation process is very, very easy. Just unpack giana
in some directory (suggested is you home dir) and that's all :)
Read FAQ.
*NOTE*: Giana2 in source version requires TCL version 8.4 or newer.
        You can find it at http://www.tcl.tk/software/.
